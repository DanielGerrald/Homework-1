# Homework-1
In this challange I added header, footer and section symantic tags.
I changed the title from website to Horiseon | Home Page.
I added comments to explain each portion of the site.
I added Alt tags to all images.
I added ID and Class to search-engine-optimization div located under content.
I changed the order so that the html text will flow top down, left to right when following along with the GUI site.
In style.css I consolidated the variables that where repeated for example (.search-engine-optimization, .online-reputation-management, .social-media-marketing)
